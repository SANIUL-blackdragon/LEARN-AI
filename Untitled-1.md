They should distinguish between discrete quantitative data (countable values, often whole numbers) and continuous quantitative data (any value within a range). Students should calculate the mean (sum of values divided by number of values), median (middle value when data is ordered), and mode (most frequently occurring value), and understand when each measure is most appropriate. They should understand that outliers (extreme values) affect the mean more than the median, and that the median is therefore a more robust measure of central tendency when outliers are present. Students should calculate measures of spread: range (difference between maximum and minimum values), interquartile range (difference between upper and lower quartiles), variance (average of squared deviations from the mean), and standard deviation (square root of variance, representing typical distance from the mean). They should understand that quartiles divide data into four equal parts, percentiles into 100 equal parts, and deciles into 10 equal parts. Students should identify outliers using methods such as the 1.5 × IQR rule (values below Q₁ - 1.5 × IQR or above Q₃ + 1.5 × IQR). They should construct and interpret appropriate graphical representations: bar charts for categorical data, histograms for continuous data, box plots for showing distribution features, and stem-and-leaf diagrams for displaying numerical data while retaining original values. Students should analyze data presented in various forms, identifying key features such as center, spread, shape, and unusual values. They should compare distributions using appropriate statistical measures and graphical representations, identifying similarities and differences. Students should interpret skewness: positive skew (tail to the right, mean > median), negative skew (tail to the left, mean < median), and symmetric distributions (mean ≈ median). They should calculate and interpret the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by mean, expressed as a percentage) for comparing variability across datasets with different means or units. Students should understand and apply linear interpolation to estimate percentiles from grouped data, assuming a uniform distribution within each class interval. Applications should include analyzing real-world datasets, comparing performance across groups, and preparing data for AI/ML algorithms.

Students should understand cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) as functions that give the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a specific value, and be able to calculate and interpret CDFs for both discrete and continuous random variables. They should use and interpret common discrete probability distributions: uniform distribution (all outcomes equally likely), binomial distribution (number of successes in fixed number of independent trials with constant probability), and Poisson distribution (number of events in fixed interval of time or space). Students should use and interpret common continuous probability distributions: uniform distribution (constant probability density over an interval), normal distribution (bell-shaped curve defined by mean and standard deviation), and exponential distribution (time between events in a Poisson process). They should calculate and interpret expected value (mean) of discrete random variables using E(X) = Σ[x × P(X=x)] and of continuous random variables using E(X) = ∫[x × f(x)]dx. Students should calculate and interpret variance using Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]² and standard deviation as the square root of variance. They should understand and apply properties of expected value and variance for linear combinations of random variables: E(aX + b) = aE(X) + b, Var(aX + b) = a²Var(X), E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y), and for independent X and Y, Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y). Students should use the standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1) and Z-scores (Z = (X - μ)/σ) to calculate probabilities for normally distributed random variables. They should understand the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution, and recognize its significance in statistical inference.

They should use descriptive statistics to preprocess and analyze data for AI applications, including identifying outliers, handling missing values, and understanding data distributions. Students should understand the concept of expected value in decision-making under uncertainty, and how it relates to optimizing AI model performance.

Students should identify simple propositions (atomic propositions that cannot be broken down further) and compound propositions (formed by combining simpler propositions using logical connectives). They should use logical notation, including propositional variables (typically lowercase letters like p, q, r) to represent propositions, and symbols for logical connectives. Students should understand and apply the following logical connectives:
- Negation (NOT, ¬): ¬p is true when p is false, and false when p is true
- Conjunction (AND, ∧): p ∧ q is true only when both p and q are true
- Disjunction (OR, ∨): p ∨ q is true when at least one of p or q is true
- Exclusive disjunction (XOR, ⊕): p ⊕ q is true when exactly one of p or q is true
- Biconditional (IFF, ↔): p ↔ q is true when p and q have the same truth value

Students should construct truth tables for logical expressions, systematically listing all possible combinations of truth values for the propositional variables and determining the resulting truth value of the expression. For expressions with one variable, they should construct a truth table with 2 rows; for expressions with two variables, they should construct a truth table with 4 rows. Students should use truth tables to analyze the behavior of logical expressions and to determine whether two expressions are logically equivalent (have the same truth values for all possible inputs).

Students should understand and identify the converse (q → p), inverse (¬p → ¬q), and contrapositive (¬q → ¬p) of a conditional statement. They should determine the logical relationships between these statements, recognizing that a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive (p → q ≡ ¬q → ¬p), but not equivalent to its converse or inverse. Students should evaluate the truth of conditional statements in various contexts, distinguishing between the truth of the conditional statement itself and the truth of its antecedent and consequent. They should understand and apply biconditional statements (p ↔ q), which can be expressed as "p if and only if q" or "p is necessary and sufficient for q", and recognize that p ↔ q is true when p and q have the same truth value. Students should construct truth tables for biconditional statements, understanding that p ↔ q is equivalent to (p → q) ∧ (q → p).

- Associative laws: x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z, x · (y · z) = (x · y) · z
- Distributive laws: x · (y + z) = x · y + x · z, x + y · z = (x + y) · (x + z)
- Identity laws: x + 0 = x, x · 1 = x
- Complement laws: x + ¬x = 1, x · ¬x = 0
- Idempotent laws: x + x = x, x · x = x
- Absorption laws: x + x · y = x, x · (x + y) = x

They should explain why fairness is critical in high-stakes applications like loan approvals, hiring, criminal justice, and healthcare, where biased decisions can have serious consequences. Students should identify different fairness definitions including demographic parity (similar outcomes across groups), equal opportunity (similar true positive rates), and individual fairness (similar individuals treated similarly). They should understand the inherent trade-offs between different fairness criteria and between fairness and other objectives like accuracy or efficiency, with examples showing how optimizing for one fairness criterion may violate another.

They should explain why transparency is important for building trust with users, ensuring accountability for decisions, identifying and fixing errors, and meeting regulatory requirements. Students should distinguish between inherently interpretable models (like decision trees or linear regression) and "black box" models (like deep neural networks) that require post-hoc explanation techniques. They should identify approaches to improve transparency including feature importance analysis, attention mechanisms, local approximation methods (like LIME), and counterfactual explanations. Examples should include how transparency helps in critical applications like medical diagnosis or loan approvals where understanding the reasoning behind decisions is essential.

**Guidance:** Students should understand supervised learning as learning with a "teacher" that provides correct answers during training. They should explain that the defining feature is the use of labeled data, where each training example includes both input features and the correct output. The concept of learning a mapping function (f: X → Y) should be introduced, where X represents input features and Y represents output labels. Students should understand that the ultimate goal is to generalize from training examples to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

**Guidance:** Students should understand classification as the task of predicting a discrete class label for an input, such as "spam" or "not spam" for emails, or "cat", "dog", or "bird" for images. They should recognize that binary classification involves exactly two possible classes, while multi-class classification involves three or more classes. For regression, students should understand it as predicting a continuous numerical value, such as the price of a house, the temperature tomorrow, or the number of sales next month. They should be able to examine different problems and correctly identify whether they require classification or regression approaches, with clear justification for their choice.

For regression, they should understand mean squared error (average of squared differences), mean absolute error (average of absolute differences), and R-squared (proportion of variance explained). Students should explain why using separate testing data is essential to assess how well the model generalizes to new examples. The concept of k-fold cross-validation should be introduced as a method to make the most of limited data while still getting robust performance estimates.

The concept should be presented as discovering inherent structures or patterns in data, similar to organizing a collection of items without being told what the categories should be. Students should understand that the goal is not prediction but rather exploration and understanding of the data's underlying structure. Analogies like exploring a new city without a guide or organizing a closet full of mixed items can help illustrate the concept.

**3.2.7 Distinguish between clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association in unsupervised learning**

**Guidance:** Students should understand clustering as the task of grouping similar data points together, with examples like customer segmentation, document grouping, or image segmentation. They should recognize that clustering algorithms aim to maximize similarity within groups and minimize similarity between groups. For dimensionality reduction, students should understand it as techniques that reduce the number of features (variables) in a dataset while trying to preserve as much important information as possible, with examples like compressing images or visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D. Association should be explained as discovering interesting relationships between variables, such as market basket analysis (finding that customers who buy X also tend to buy Y). Students should be able to examine different problems and identify which type of unsupervised learning approach would be most appropriate.

They should explain that dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) identify the directions (components) in the data that capture the most variation, effectively projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space. For association, students should understand algorithms like Apriori that find frequent itemsets and generate association rules based on measures like support, confidence, and lift. They should recognize the challenge of evaluating unsupervised learning without ground truth labels, requiring metrics like silhouette score for clustering or reconstruction error for dimensionality reduction.

For dimensionality reduction, they should understand reconstruction error (how well the reduced representation can reconstruct the original data) and explained variance (how much of the original data's variance is preserved by the reduced representation). Students should explain that these metrics provide quantitative measures but often require domain knowledge for meaningful interpretation, and that the ultimate test of unsupervised learning is often its usefulness in downstream tasks or applications.

**3.2.10 Recognize real-world applications of unsupervised learning**
- Identify applications of clustering in various domains (customer segmentation, document analysis)

They should recognize dimensionality reduction applications like visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D plots, extracting features for subsequent supervised learning, and compressing data while preserving important information. For association, students should understand market basket analysis in retail (discovering which products are frequently purchased together) and recommendation systems (suggesting items based on associations). They should explain how unsupervised learning can reveal hidden patterns and structures that might not be apparent through supervised approaches, such as discovering new customer segments or identifying unexpected relationships between variables.

**3.2.11 Define reinforcement learning and identify its core characteristics**
- Define reinforcement learning as a machine learning approach based on learning from actions and consequences
- Identify the key characteristic of reinforcement learning: learning through trial and error with feedback
- Explain the reinforcement learning process: agents taking actions in environments to maximize cumulative rewards
- Describe the goal of reinforcement learning: learning optimal policies for decision-making

**Guidance:** Students should understand reinforcement learning as learning through experience, where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. They should explain that the defining feature is learning from the consequences of actions rather than from labeled examples. The concept should be presented as a cycle of agent-environment interaction: the agent observes the environment state, takes an action, receives a reward, and observes the new state. Students should understand that the goal is to learn a policy (a strategy for choosing actions) that maximizes cumulative rewards over time. Analogies like training a pet with treats for good behavior, a child learning through trial and error, or a game player developing strategies through experience can help illustrate the concept.

**3.2.12 Explain the key components of reinforcement learning (agents, environments, states, actions, rewards)**
- Define agents as the learners or decision-makers in reinforcement learning
- Define environments as the world with which the agent interacts
- Define states as the current situation or configuration of the environment
- Define actions as the choices available to the agent at each state
- Define rewards as the feedback signals that evaluate the agent's actions

**Guidance:** Students should understand the agent as the entity that learns and makes decisions, such as a robot, a game-playing program, or a recommendation system. They should explain the environment as everything outside the agent that the agent interacts with, such as a physical world, a game, or users. States should be described as snapshots of the environment that provide the context for decision-making, like the position of pieces on a chessboard or the location of obstacles for a robot. Actions should be explained as the set of possible moves or decisions the agent can make in each state. Rewards should be understood as numerical signals that indicate how good or bad the agent's actions were, with positive rewards encouraging certain behaviors and negative rewards discouraging others. Students should be able to identify these components in simple reinforcement learning scenarios.

**3.2.13 Describe how reinforcement learning algorithms learn through trial and error**
- Explain the concept of exploration vs. exploitation in reinforcement learning
- Describe how agents learn from delayed rewards and credit assignment
- Understand the role of value functions in evaluating states and actions
- Explain how policy improvement occurs through learning from experience

**Guidance:** Students should understand the exploration-exploitation dilemma as the trade-off between trying new actions to discover better strategies (exploration) and using known good actions to maximize rewards (exploitation). They should explain that reinforcement learning often involves delayed rewards, where the consequences of actions may not be immediately apparent, requiring credit assignment (determining which actions led to good or bad outcomes). The concept of value functions should be introduced as estimates of future rewards, helping the agent evaluate which states and actions are likely to lead to good outcomes. Students should understand that policy improvement occurs as the agent updates its strategy based on experience, gradually shifting toward actions that yield higher rewards. Simple examples like learning to navigate a maze or play a simple game can illustrate these concepts.

**3.2.14 Distinguish between different types of reinforcement learning approaches**
- Differentiate between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning
- Distinguish between value-based and policy-based reinforcement learning
- Identify examples of algorithms in each category (Q-learning, SARSA, REINFORCE, etc.)
- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches

**Guidance:** Students should understand model-based reinforcement learning as approaches that learn or use a model of the environment (how the environment responds to actions), while model-free approaches learn directly from experience without building an explicit model. They should distinguish between value-based methods (which learn value functions to evaluate states or actions, like Q-learning and SARSA) and policy-based methods (which directly learn the policy, like REINFORCE and policy gradient methods). Students should recognize that actor-critic methods combine elements of both value-based and policy-based approaches. They should explain that model-based methods can be more sample-efficient but require accurate environment models, while model-free methods are more flexible but typically require more experience. Similarly, value-based methods are often more stable but may have limitations in action spaces, while policy-based methods can handle continuous action spaces but may be less stable during training.

**3.2.15 Recognize real-world applications of reinforcement learning**
- Identify applications in game playing (chess, Go, video games)
- Identify applications in robotics and control systems
- Identify applications in recommendation systems and resource management
- Explain how reinforcement learning solves sequential decision-making problems

**Guidance:** Students should identify concrete examples of reinforcement learning applications, such as game-playing systems like AlphaGo (which defeated world champions in Go) and AI systems for chess, poker, and video games. They should recognize robotics applications like teaching robots to walk, grasp objects, or navigate environments, and control systems applications like optimizing energy usage in data centers or controlling autonomous vehicles. For recommendation systems, students should understand how reinforcement learning can optimize long-term user engagement rather than immediate clicks. They should explain that reinforcement learning is particularly suited for sequential decision-making problems where actions affect future states and rewards, such as playing games, controlling robots, or managing resources over time. Students should analyze the impact of these applications and how they demonstrate the ability of reinforcement learning to learn complex behaviors through experience.

**3.2.16 Compare and contrast the key differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning**
- Identify differences in the type of data used (labeled, unlabeled, experience through interaction)
- Compare the learning objectives (prediction, pattern discovery, decision-making)
- Contrast the feedback mechanisms (explicit labels, no feedback, rewards/penalties)
- Distinguish the types of problems each approach is best suited to solve

**Guidance:** Students should understand that supervised learning uses labeled data with explicit input-output pairs, unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data without predefined outputs, and reinforcement learning learns from experience through interaction with an environment. They should compare the learning objectives: supervised learning aims to predict outputs for new inputs, unsupervised learning aims to discover hidden patterns or structures in data, and reinforcement learning aims to learn optimal decision-making policies. For feedback mechanisms, students should explain that supervised learning receives explicit correct answers, unsupervised learning receives no direct feedback, and reinforcement learning receives evaluative feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. They should distinguish the types of problems each approach solves: supervised learning for prediction problems with available labeled data, unsupervised learning for exploration and pattern discovery, and reinforcement learning for sequential decision-making problems where actions affect future outcomes.

**3.2.17 Determine which type of learning is appropriate for different problems**
- Analyze problem characteristics to select the appropriate learning approach
- Identify the data requirements for each type of learning
- Evaluate the availability of feedback mechanisms in different scenarios
- Match real-world problems to the most suitable learning approach

**Guidance:** Students should learn to analyze problems based on key characteristics like the availability of labeled data, the nature of the desired output, and the type of feedback available. They should understand that supervised learning is appropriate when labeled data is available and the goal is prediction (e.g., predicting house prices with historical price data). Unsupervised learning is suitable when exploring data without predefined labels or discovering hidden patterns (e.g., segmenting customers without predefined segments). Reinforcement learning is appropriate for sequential decision-making problems where an agent can interact with an environment and receive feedback (e.g., training a robot to navigate a maze). Students should evaluate scenarios based on data availability, problem structure, and feedback mechanisms to determine the most appropriate learning approach. They should practice matching various real-world problems to the most suitable learning type with clear justification for their choices.

**3.2.18 Explain the advantages and disadvantages of each learning approach**
- Identify the strengths and limitations of supervised learning
- Identify the strengths and limitations of unsupervised learning
- Identify the strengths and limitations of reinforcement learning
- Compare the computational requirements and data needs of each approach

**Guidance:** Students should understand that supervised learning advantages include clear objectives, straightforward evaluation, and good performance when quality labeled data is available, while disadvantages include the need for labeled data (which can be expensive or time-consuming to obtain) and limited ability to discover patterns beyond what's represented in the labels. For unsupervised learning, advantages include the ability to discover hidden patterns without labeled data and potential for novel insights, while disadvantages include difficulty in evaluation and less direct control over the learning process. Reinforcement learning advantages include the ability to learn complex behaviors through trial and error and suitability for sequential decision-making problems, while disadvantages include high sample complexity, challenges with credit assignment, and potential safety issues during exploration. Students should compare the computational requirements and data needs, recognizing that supervised learning typically needs moderate amounts of labeled data, unsupervised learning can work with large amounts of unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning often requires extensive interaction with the environment.

**3.2.19 Recognize hybrid and semi-supervised learning approaches**
- Define semi-supervised learning as using both labeled and unlabeled data
- Define self-supervised learning as creating supervisory signals from unlabeled data
- Identify scenarios where hybrid approaches are beneficial
- Explain how hybrid approaches combine strengths of different learning types

**Guidance:** Students should understand semi-supervised learning as an approach that leverages both small amounts of labeled data and larger amounts of unlabeled data, which is useful when labeling is expensive or time-consuming. They should explain self-supervised learning as a technique where models generate their own supervisory signals from unlabeled data, such as predicting masked parts of input or learning representations through pretext tasks. Students should identify scenarios where hybrid approaches are beneficial, such as when limited labeled data is available but large amounts of unlabeled data exist, or when combining prediction with pattern discovery would be advantageous. They should explain how hybrid approaches combine strengths, like semi-supervised learning leveraging the pattern discovery capabilities of unsupervised learning to improve supervised learning with limited labels, or reinforcement learning incorporating supervised learning for specific components of a larger system. Examples should include semi-supervised learning for text classification with limited labeled documents or self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning in computer vision.

**Guidance:** Students should understand linear regression as a fundamental supervised learning algorithm used to predict a continuous outcome variable (y) based on one or more predictor variables (x). They should visualize simple linear regression as finding the best straight line that fits through a scatter plot of data points. For the mathematical representation, students should recognize that in simple linear regression (one predictor variable), the equation takes the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. In multiple linear regression (multiple predictor variables), the equation expands to y = b₀ + b₁x₁ + b₂x₂ + ... + bₙxₙ, where b₀ is the intercept and b₁ to bₙ are the coefficients for each predictor variable. Students should be able to identify and explain each component of the equation, understanding that coefficients represent the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding all other variables constant.

- Explain how the optimal coefficients are determined to minimize prediction errors

**Guidance:** Students should understand that training a linear regression model involves finding the optimal values for the coefficients that minimize the difference between predicted values and actual values. They should explain the method of least squares as finding the line that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals (the vertical distances between data points and the regression line). The concept of the cost function should be introduced as a mathematical expression that quantifies the error between predictions and actual values, with the goal being to minimize this function. Students should understand gradient descent as an optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts the coefficients in the direction that reduces the cost function, similar to walking downhill to find the lowest point. They should recognize that the training process continues until the algorithm converges on the optimal coefficients that minimize prediction errors.

- Explain the importance of each assumption for valid regression results
- Identify situations where linear regression may not be appropriate
- Understand the consequences of violating linear regression assumptions
- Recognize the limitations of linear regression in capturing complex relationships

**Guidance:** Students should identify the key assumptions of linear regression: linearity (the relationship between independent and dependent variables is linear), independence (observations are independent of each other), homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), and normality (errors are normally distributed). They should explain why each assumption is important, such as how violating the linearity assumption can lead to poor predictions, or how violating independence can result in unreliable coefficient estimates. Students should recognize situations where linear regression is inappropriate, such as when relationships are highly nonlinear, when there are complex interactions between variables, or when the data has significant outliers. They should understand the consequences of assumption violations, including biased coefficients, incorrect standard errors, and unreliable predictions. Students should also acknowledge the limitations of linear regression in capturing complex, nonlinear patterns in data.

They should understand R-squared (coefficient of determination) as a measure that indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables, ranging from 0 to 1 (higher values indicate better fit). Students should be able to calculate and interpret Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the square root of MSE (in the same units as the dependent variable). They should understand the importance of residual analysis, including examining residual plots to identify patterns that might indicate violations of assumptions or model inadequacies. Students should practice applying these metrics to evaluate linear regression models and interpret their results in practical contexts.

They should understand basic data preparation steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting data into training and testing sets. Students should gain hands-on experience implementing simple linear regression using appropriate tools or software, focusing on the process rather than complex programming. They should learn to interpret the coefficients of the model to understand the relationships between variables and make predictions for new data points. Finally, students should practice communicating the results of linear regression analysis in clear, non-technical language, explaining what the model reveals about the problem being studied.

**Guidance:** Students should understand classification as a supervised learning task where the goal is to predict a discrete categorical label or class, in contrast to regression which predicts continuous numerical values. They should clearly distinguish between the two based on the nature of the output variable: categorical for classification (e.g., "spam" or "not spam") versus numerical for regression (e.g., house price). Students should differentiate between binary classification, which involves predicting one of two possible classes (e.g., yes/no, true/false), and multi-class classification, which involves predicting one of three or more classes (e.g., cat/dog/bird, type of flower). The concept of decision boundaries should be introduced as the regions in feature space that separate different classes. Students should identify real-world examples of classification problems, such as email spam detection, image recognition, medical diagnosis, credit scoring, and sentiment analysis.

**3.3.7 Explain how decision tree algorithms work**

- Explain how decision trees make predictions by traversing from root to leaf
- Understand the concept of splitting criteria (Gini impurity, information gain)
- Identify the process of building a decision tree through recursive partitioning
- Recognize the advantages and limitations of decision trees

**Guidance:** Students should understand the structure of a decision tree, which consists of a root node (topmost node representing the entire dataset), internal nodes (decision points that test features), branches (outcomes of decisions), and leaf nodes (final predictions or class labels). They should explain how predictions are made by traversing the tree from the root node to a leaf node, following the decisions at each internal node based on the feature values of the input. Students should learn about splitting criteria used to determine the best features and split points at each node, including Gini impurity (measuring the degree of impurity in a set of examples) and information gain (measuring the reduction in entropy after a split). They should understand the process of building a decision tree through recursive partitioning, where the dataset is repeatedly split into subsets based on the best features until a stopping criterion is met. Students should recognize the advantages of decision trees (interpretability, handling of nonlinear relationships, no need for feature scaling) and limitations (tendency to overfit, instability with small data changes, bias toward features with many levels).

**Guidance:** Students should understand KNN as an instance-based learning algorithm that makes predictions based on the similarity of new data points to existing labeled examples. They should explain that KNN stores all training examples and makes predictions for new data points by finding the k most similar examples (nearest neighbors) in the training data and using their labels to determine the prediction (e.g., majority voting for classification). Students should learn about distance metrics used to measure similarity, including Euclidean distance (straight-line distance between points) and Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences between coordinates). They should understand how the choice of k (number of neighbors) affects the model's performance, with smaller k values leading to more complex, potentially overfit models, and larger k values leading to smoother, potentially underfit models. Students should recognize the advantages of KNN (simplicity, no training phase, ability to handle complex decision boundaries) and limitations (computational inefficiency with large datasets, sensitivity to irrelevant features, need for feature scaling).

**3.3.9 Evaluate classification models using appropriate metrics**

- Explain how to create and interpret a confusion matrix
- Calculate and interpret precision, recall, and F1-score from a confusion matrix
- Understand the trade-off between precision and recall
- Apply evaluation metrics to assess the performance of classification models

**Guidance:** Students should learn to use appropriate metrics to evaluate the performance of classification models. They should understand accuracy as the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions, but recognize its limitations, especially with imbalanced datasets. Students should learn to create and interpret a confusion matrix, which shows the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. They should be able to calculate and interpret precision (the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions) as a measure of exactness, recall (the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified) as a measure of completeness, and F1-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) as a balanced measure that considers both. Students should understand the trade-off between precision and recall, where improving one often comes at the cost of the other, and how this trade-off can be managed based on the specific requirements of the application. They should practice applying these metrics to evaluate classification models and interpret their results in practical contexts.

Students should gain hands-on experience implementing simple classification models using appropriate tools or software, focusing on the process rather than complex programming. They should learn to interpret the predictions of classification models, including not just the predicted class but also the confidence or probability associated with the prediction. Finally, students should practice communicating the results of classification analysis in clear, non-technical language, explaining what the model reveals about the problem being studied and the implications of the predictions.

**3.3.11 Define clustering and distinguish it from classification**

- Recognize real-world examples of clustering problems

**Guidance:** Students should understand clustering as an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together without using predefined labels, in contrast to classification which uses labeled data to learn patterns. They should clearly distinguish between the two based on the availability of labels: clustering works with unlabeled data to discover inherent groupings, while classification learns from labeled examples to assign new data to predefined classes. Students should explain that the goal of clustering is to discover hidden patterns or structures in data by grouping similar data points together and separating dissimilar ones. They should understand that clustering aims to maximize intra-cluster similarity (data points within the same cluster are similar) and inter-cluster dissimilarity (data points in different clusters are dissimilar). Students should identify real-world examples of clustering problems, such as customer segmentation, document grouping, image segmentation, anomaly detection, and pattern discovery.

**3.3.12 Explain how k-means clustering algorithm works**

- Understand the concept of cluster centroids and their role in k-means
- Identify how the number of clusters (k) is determined
- Recognize the advantages and limitations of k-means clustering

**Guidance:** Students should understand k-means as a partitioning clustering method that divides data into k non-overlapping clusters. They should explain the iterative process of k-means, which consists of two main steps: assignment (assigning each data point to the nearest centroid) and update (recalculating the centroids as the mean of all data points assigned to that cluster). Students should understand that cluster centroids represent the center of each cluster and serve as reference points for assigning data points. They should learn about methods for determining the optimal number of clusters (k), such as the elbow method (plotting the within-cluster sum of squares against different values of k and looking for an "elbow" point) and the silhouette method (measuring how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters). Students should recognize the advantages of k-means (simplicity, efficiency with large datasets, ease of implementation) and limitations (sensitivity to initial centroids, difficulty with non-globular clusters, requirement to specify k in advance, sensitivity to outliers).

**3.3.13 Evaluate clustering results using appropriate metrics**

- Explain how to interpret the silhouette score for cluster quality
- Understand the concept of within-cluster and between-cluster distances
- Apply evaluation metrics to assess the quality of clustering results
- Recognize the challenges of evaluating clustering without ground truth

**Guidance:** Students should learn to use appropriate metrics to evaluate the quality of clustering results, acknowledging the challenge of evaluating unsupervised learning without ground truth labels. They should understand inertia (within-cluster sum of squares) as a measure of how internally coherent clusters are, with lower values indicating denser clusters. Students should learn to calculate and interpret the silhouette score, which measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters, ranging from -1 to 1 (higher values indicate better clustering). They should understand the concept of within-cluster distance (how close data points are to each other within the same cluster) and between-cluster distance (how far apart different clusters are), with good clustering having small within-cluster distances and large between-cluster distances. Students should practice applying these metrics to evaluate clustering results and interpret their scores, recognizing that while these metrics provide quantitative measures, domain knowledge and visual inspection are also important for assessing clustering quality.

They should understand basic data preparation steps for clustering, including handling missing values, feature scaling (especially important for distance-based algorithms like k-means), and potentially dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional data. Students should gain hands-on experience implementing simple clustering models using appropriate tools or software, focusing on the process rather than complex programming. They should learn to interpret the results of clustering analysis, including identifying the characteristics of each cluster and understanding what makes data points within the same cluster similar. Finally, students should practice communicating the insights gained from clustering in clear, non-technical language, explaining how the discovered groupings can inform decision-making or reveal hidden patterns in the data.

- Understand the relationship between model selection and the bias-variance trade-off
- Recognize the consequences of poor model selection

**Guidance:** Students should understand model selection as the process of choosing the most appropriate machine learning algorithm or model for a specific problem from a set of candidate models. They should explain that model selection is crucial because different algorithms have different strengths, weaknesses, and assumptions, and choosing the wrong model can lead to poor performance, unreliable predictions, or missed insights. Students should identify the goals of model selection, including optimizing predictive performance on new data, balancing model complexity (to avoid overfitting or underfitting), and considering practical constraints like computational efficiency or interpretability. They should understand the relationship between model selection and the bias-variance trade-off, where simpler models tend to have high bias and low variance (potentially underfitting), while more complex models tend to have low bias and high variance (potentially overfitting). Students should recognize the consequences of poor model selection, such as suboptimal performance, wasted resources, misleading conclusions, or failed deployments.

**3.3.16 Identify factors to consider when selecting a machine learning algorithm**

- Consider the nature and quality of available data
- Evaluate the need for model interpretability
- Assess computational resources and time constraints
- Consider the expected performance and robustness requirements

**Guidance:** Students should learn to consider multiple factors when selecting a machine learning algorithm. They should recognize that the problem type (classification, regression, clustering, etc.) is a primary consideration, as different algorithms are designed for different types of problems. Students should evaluate the nature and quality of available data, including the amount of data, the number of features, the presence of missing values or outliers, and whether the data is labeled or unlabeled. They should assess the need for model interpretability, as some algorithms (like decision trees) are more easily explained than others (like neural networks), which can be important in domains like healthcare or finance where explanations are required. Students should consider computational resources and time constraints, as some algorithms require more processing power or take longer to train than others. They should also evaluate expected performance and robustness requirements, considering factors like accuracy needs, tolerance for errors, and the stability of the model under different conditions.

**3.3.17 Explain the concept of overfitting and underfitting in model selection**

- Define underfitting as a model that fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data
- Identify the relationship between model complexity and overfitting/underfitting
- Explain how to detect overfitting and underfitting using learning curves
- Understand strategies to address overfitting and underfitting

**Guidance:** Students should understand overfitting as a situation where a model learns the training data too well, including random noise and specific patterns that don't generalize to new data, resulting in high performance on training data but poor performance on test data. They should define underfitting as a situation where a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and test data. Students should identify the relationship between model complexity and overfitting/underfitting, recognizing that as model complexity increases, the risk of overfitting increases, while as model complexity decreases, the risk of underfitting increases. They should explain how to detect overfitting and underfitting using learning curves, which plot model performance against training data size or model complexity, showing gaps between training and validation performance. Students should understand strategies to address overfitting (e.g., reducing model complexity, using regularization, increasing training data, cross-validation) and underfitting (e.g., increasing model complexity, feature engineering, reducing regularization).

**3.3.18 Apply simple model selection to given scenarios**

**Guidance:** Students should practice analyzing problem scenarios to identify key characteristics and requirements that inform model selection. They should evaluate candidate algorithms based on their suitability for the problem, considering factors like problem type, data characteristics, performance requirements, interpretability needs, and resource constraints. Students should learn to justify their selection of a specific algorithm for a given scenario, providing clear reasons why the chosen algorithm is appropriate and why alternatives are less suitable. They should consider and articulate the trade-offs between different algorithm choices, acknowledging that there is rarely a single "best" algorithm and that different choices may prioritize different aspects (e.g., interpretability vs. accuracy, simplicity vs. performance). Finally, students should practice communicating their model selection decisions and rationale in clear, structured arguments, both in writing and verbally, to demonstrate their understanding of the model selection process.

##### **Topic 4: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**

**Guidance:** Students should understand data cleaning as a fundamental preprocessing step that involves detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt, inaccurate, or irrelevant records from a dataset. They should explain that data cleaning is crucial because the quality of data directly affects the quality of machine learning models - models trained on poor-quality data will produce poor-quality results. Students should identify specific negative impacts of poor data quality, including biased models, inaccurate predictions, reduced model performance, and unreliable insights. They should understand the "garbage in, garbage out" principle, which emphasizes that even the most sophisticated algorithms cannot produce meaningful results from flawed data. Students should recognize that data cleaning often consumes a significant portion of time in machine learning projects (sometimes up to 80%) but is essential for building reliable and effective models.

**3.4.2 Identify common data quality issues that require cleaning**

**Guidance:** Students should learn to identify various types of data quality issues. For missing data, they should understand the distinction between Missing Completely At Random (MCAR), Missing At Random (MAR), and Missing Not At Random (MNAR), and how each type might require different handling approaches. They should recognize duplicate records as identical or near-identical entries that can skew analysis results. Students should learn to identify outliers as data points that deviate significantly from other observations, understanding they may result from measurement errors, data entry mistakes, or genuine but extreme values. They should recognize inconsistent data formats (e.g., dates in different formats, inconsistent capitalization) and incorrect or invalid entries (e.g., negative ages, impossible values). Students should also identify structural errors like mismatched data types (e.g., numbers stored as text) or violations of data constraints (e.g., unique constraints violated).

**3.4.3 Apply techniques to handle missing values**

**Guidance:** Students should learn to implement various techniques for handling missing values. They should understand deletion methods, including listwise deletion (removing entire records with missing values) and pairwise deletion (using available data for each analysis), recognizing when these approaches are appropriate (e.g., when missing data is MCAR and the proportion of missing data is small). For imputation of numerical data, students should apply methods like mean, median, and mode imputation, understanding the advantages and limitations of each. For categorical data, they should learn techniques like mode imputation or creating a separate category for missing values. Students should be introduced to more advanced imputation techniques like regression imputation (predicting missing values using other variables) and k-NN imputation (using values from similar records), understanding when these might be preferable. They should evaluate which technique is most appropriate based on the nature and extent of missing data, the type of analysis, and the underlying assumptions. Students should also learn about using missing value indicators (binary features indicating whether a value was missing) as a feature engineering approach to preserve information about the missingness pattern.

**3.4.4 Apply techniques to handle duplicate records**
- Identify exact duplicates in a dataset
- Implement techniques to remove duplicate records
- Recognize and handle near-duplicates (fuzzy duplicates)
- Understand the impact of duplicate removal on dataset size and integrity
- Document duplicate removal decisions and processes
- Evaluate the necessity of preserving certain apparent duplicates

**Guidance:** Students should learn to identify exact duplicates (records that are identical across all fields) using appropriate tools or functions. They should implement techniques to remove these duplicates, understanding that this process typically involves keeping one instance of each unique record and discarding the rest. Students should recognize that some duplicates may not be exact matches but could be near-duplicates (fuzzy duplicates) that differ only slightly due to data entry errors, formatting differences, or minor variations. They should learn techniques to identify and handle these fuzzy duplicates, such as using similarity measures or fuzzy matching algorithms. Students should understand the impact of duplicate removal on dataset size and integrity, recognizing that while duplicates can skew analysis, their removal should be done carefully to avoid losing important information. They should learn to document their decisions and processes for handling duplicates, including the criteria used and the number of duplicates removed. Finally, students should evaluate situations where apparent duplicates might actually represent legitimate multiple entries (e.g., multiple transactions by the same customer at the same time) and should be preserved.

**3.4.5 Apply techniques to detect and handle outliers**

- Evaluate the impact of outlier handling on model performance

**Guidance:** Students should learn to identify different types of outliers: global outliers (data points that deviate significantly from the overall dataset), contextual outliers (data points that deviate within a specific context), and collective outliers (a subset of data points that deviate collectively from the entire dataset). They should apply statistical methods for outlier detection, including the z-score method (identifying points with z-scores beyond a threshold, typically ±3) and the Interquartile Range (IQR) method (identifying points below Q1-1.5×IQR or above Q3+1.5×IQR). Students should also use visualization techniques like box plots and scatter plots to visually identify outliers. They should understand that outliers may result from measurement errors, data entry mistakes, sampling errors, or may represent legitimate but extreme values, and that determining the cause is important for deciding how to handle them. Students should implement strategies for handling outliers, including removal (eliminating outlier records), transformation (applying mathematical transformations to reduce the impact of outliers), and capping (replacing extreme values with less extreme ones). Finally, they should evaluate how different outlier handling strategies affect model performance, recognizing that the optimal approach depends on the specific dataset and algorithm being used.

**3.4.6 Define data transformation and explain its need in machine learning**

- Explain why data transformation is necessary for machine learning algorithms
- Identify how different algorithms have different data requirements
- Understand the impact of data transformation on model performance
- Recognize data transformation as a step to make data more suitable for analysis

**Guidance:** Students should understand data transformation as the process of converting data from one format or structure into another to make it more appropriate for machine learning algorithms. They should explain that data transformation is necessary because different algorithms have different assumptions and requirements regarding data distribution, scale, and format. For example, some algorithms assume normally distributed data, while others are sensitive to the scale of features. Students should identify how different algorithms have specific data requirements, such as distance-based algorithms (like k-NN) being sensitive to feature scales, or tree-based algorithms being less affected by monotonic transformations. They should understand that appropriate data transformation can improve model performance, speed up training, and help algorithms converge more effectively. Students should recognize data transformation as a crucial step to make data more suitable for analysis by addressing issues like skewed distributions, varying scales, or non-linear relationships between features and target variables.

**3.4.7 Apply normalization techniques to scale numerical features**

- Understand when normalization is appropriate and when it might not be needed
- Recognize algorithms that benefit from normalized data
- Evaluate the impact of normalization on model performance

**Guidance:** Students should understand normalization as a technique to rescale numerical features to a specific range, typically [0,1]. They should implement min-max normalization, which transforms features using the formula: x_normalized = (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)), where min(x) and max(x) are the minimum and maximum values of the feature. Students should apply normalization to handle features with different scales and units, recognizing that features with larger scales can dominate those with smaller scales in many algorithms. They should understand when normalization is appropriate (e.g., for algorithms that use distance calculations, gradient descent-based algorithms) and when it might not be needed (e.g., tree-based algorithms that are insensitive to feature scaling). Students should recognize algorithms that particularly benefit from normalized data, including k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Principal Component Analysis, and neural networks. Finally, they should evaluate how normalization affects model performance, comparing results with and without normalization to understand its impact.

**3.4.8 Apply standardization techniques to scale numerical features**
- Define standardization as transforming features to have zero mean and unit variance
- Implement z-score standardization using the formula: z = (x - μ) / σ
- Apply standardization to handle features with different scales and distributions
- Distinguish between normalization and standardization
- Understand when standardization is preferred over normalization
- Recognize algorithms that benefit from standardized data

**Guidance:** Students should understand standardization as a technique to transform features to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. They should implement z-score standardization using the formula: z = (x - μ) / σ, where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the feature. Students should apply standardization to handle features with different scales and distributions, recognizing that it is less sensitive to outliers than min-max normalization. They should distinguish between normalization (scaling to a specific range, typically [0,1]) and standardization (transforming to have zero mean and unit variance), understanding that normalization bounds values to a specific range while standardization does not restrict the range but centers the distribution around zero. Students should understand when standardization is preferred over normalization, such as when the data follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution, when the algorithm assumes zero-centered data (like many linear models), or when the data contains significant outliers. They should recognize algorithms that particularly benefit from standardized data, including linear regression, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and principal component analysis.

**3.4.9 Apply encoding techniques for categorical data**
- Identify different types of categorical variables (nominal, ordinal)
- Implement one-hot encoding for nominal categorical variables
- Apply label encoding for ordinal categorical variables
- Understand the impact of different encoding techniques on model performance
- Recognize when to use each encoding technique based on the algorithm and data
- Handle high-cardinality categorical variables with appropriate encoding techniques

**Guidance:** Students should learn to identify different types of categorical variables: nominal variables (categories with no inherent order, like colors or countries) and ordinal variables (categories with a meaningful order, like education levels or ratings). They should implement one-hot encoding for nominal variables, which creates binary columns for each category, with a value of 1 if the category is present and 0 otherwise. For ordinal variables, students should apply label encoding, which assigns a unique integer to each category while preserving the order. They should understand how different encoding techniques impact model performance, recognizing that one-hot encoding can lead to high dimensionality (especially with many categories) while label encoding may introduce artificial ordinal relationships that don't exist in nominal data. Students should recognize when to use each technique based on the algorithm (e.g., tree-based algorithms can handle label-encoded ordinal variables well, while linear models may require one-hot encoding for nominal variables) and the nature of the data. Finally, they should learn techniques to handle high-cardinality categorical variables (those with many unique values), such as target encoding (replacing categories with the mean of the target variable for that category) or feature hashing (hashing categories into a lower-dimensional space).

**3.4.10 Define feature selection and explain its importance in machine learning**

- Recognize feature selection as a balance between model complexity and performance
- Distinguish between feature selection and feature extraction

**Guidance:** Students should understand feature selection as the process of selecting a subset of relevant features (variables, predictors) for use in model construction. They should explain that feature selection is important because it helps to simplify models, improve their performance, and reduce computational costs. Students should identify the benefits of feature selection, including improved model performance (by removing irrelevant or redundant features), reduced overfitting (by reducing model complexity), faster training and prediction times, and improved model interpretability. They should understand the relationship between feature selection and the curse of dimensionality (the phenomenon where the performance of algorithms deteriorates as the number of dimensions increases), recognizing that feature selection can help mitigate this issue. Students should recognize feature selection as a balance between model complexity and performance, where too few features may lead to underfitting while too many features may lead to overfitting. Finally, they should distinguish between feature selection (selecting a subset of existing features) and feature extraction (creating new features from existing ones, like in Principal Component Analysis).

**Guidance:** Students should understand filter methods as feature selection techniques that select features based on their statistical properties, without considering the performance of any specific machine learning algorithm. They should implement correlation-based feature selection to identify and remove highly correlated features (since they provide redundant information), using correlation matrices and heatmaps to visualize correlations. Students should apply statistical tests like chi-square (for categorical features and targets) and ANOVA (for numerical features and categorical targets) to select features based on their statistical relationship with the target variable. They should use information-theoretic measures like mutual information and information gain, which quantify how much information one variable provides about another, to select features that are most informative about the target. Students should understand the advantages of filter methods (computational efficiency, model-agnostic nature, good for high-dimensional data) and limitations (ignore feature interactions, may not select features that work well together for a specific model). Finally, they should evaluate the effectiveness of filter methods in different scenarios, recognizing that they are particularly useful as a preprocessing step to reduce dimensionality before applying more computationally intensive feature selection methods or model training.

Students should apply forward selection (starting with no features and adding the most beneficial feature one at a time) and backward elimination (starting with all features and removing the least beneficial feature one at a time), understanding how these greedy algorithms search through the feature space. They should understand the computational complexity of wrapper methods, recognizing that they involve training and evaluating multiple models, which can be computationally expensive, especially with large feature sets. Students should evaluate the trade-offs between the improved performance (since features are selected based on their contribution to a specific model) and the increased computational cost. They should recognize that wrapper methods are most appropriate when computational resources are sufficient, the number of features is moderate, and model performance is a critical concern.

Students should apply tree-based feature importance methods, which rank features based on how much they improve the purity of nodes in decision trees or random forests. They should understand how embedded methods combine advantages of filter methods (computational efficiency) and wrapper methods (model-specific feature selection), by incorporating feature selection as part of the model training process. Students should evaluate the effectiveness of embedded methods in different scenarios, recognizing that they are particularly efficient for high-dimensional datasets and provide a good balance between computational cost and model performance. Finally, they should recognize which machine learning algorithms have built-in feature selection capabilities, including Lasso and Elastic Net for linear models, decision trees and random forests for tree-based models, and some implementations of support vector machines.

**Guidance:** Students should understand data splitting as the process of dividing a dataset into distinct subsets for different purposes in the machine learning workflow. They should explain that data splitting is essential for evaluating model performance because it allows us to assess how well a model generalizes to new, unseen data, which is the ultimate goal of machine learning. Students should identify the different purposes of data subsets: the training set (used to train the model), the validation set (used to tune hyperparameters and make decisions about the model), and the test set (used only once to evaluate the final model's performance). They should understand the concept of generalization error (the error rate on new, unseen data) and how data splitting helps estimate this by holding out a portion of the data that the model doesn't see during training. Students should recognize data splitting as a fundamental technique for assessing model performance and detecting overfitting, which occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data. Finally, they should understand the relationship between data splitting and model validation strategies, such as cross-validation, which systematically splits the data in multiple ways to provide more robust performance estimates.

**Guidance:** Students should learn to implement a simple train-test split using random sampling, where the dataset is randomly divided into a training set and a test set. They should apply stratified sampling, which ensures that the distribution of classes (or other important characteristics) is maintained across splits, which is particularly important for imbalanced datasets. Students should determine appropriate ratios for splitting data, understanding that common ratios include 70-30 or 80-20 for train-test splits, and 60-20-20 or 70-15-15 for train-validation-test splits, recognizing that the optimal ratio depends on the size of the dataset and the specific requirements of the problem. They should understand the importance of setting random seeds for reproducibility, ensuring that the same random split can be generated each time the code is run. Students should implement three-way splits for training, validation, and testing, understanding that the validation set is used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection, while the test set is reserved for final evaluation. Finally, they should evaluate how different splitting strategies (e.g., random vs. stratified, different ratios) affect model evaluation, recognizing that the choice of splitting strategy can impact the reliability of performance estimates.

- Explain how data splitting helps detect overfitting and underfitting

**Guidance:** Students should understand overfitting as a situation where a model learns the training data too well, including random noise and specific patterns that don't generalize to new data, resulting in high performance on training data but poor performance on test data. They should define underfitting as a situation where a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and test data. Students should identify the relationship between model complexity and overfitting/underfitting, recognizing that as model complexity increases, the risk of overfitting increases, while as model complexity decreases, the risk of underfitting increases. They should recognize the symptoms of overfitting and underfitting in learning curves, which plot model performance against training data size or model complexity, showing gaps between training and validation performance for overfitting, and poor performance on both for underfitting. Students should understand the bias-variance tradeoff, where bias (error from erroneous assumptions) and variance (error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in training data) are inversely related, and overfitting corresponds to low bias and high variance, while underfitting corresponds to high bias and low variance. Finally, they should explain how data splitting helps detect overfitting (large gap between training and test performance) and underfitting (poor performance on both training and test data).

**Guidance:** Students should understand cross-validation as a resampling technique that systematically splits the data into multiple subsets and evaluates model performance across these splits, providing a more robust estimate of model performance than a simple train-test split. They should implement k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into k equal-sized folds, the model is trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold, and this process is repeated k times with each fold used as the test set once. Students should apply stratified k-fold cross-validation, which maintains the class distribution in each fold, particularly important for imbalanced datasets. They should understand leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), where k equals the number of instances in the dataset, meaning each instance is used as the test set once, and recognize its computational implications (training a model n times for n instances, which can be prohibitively expensive for large datasets). Students should recognize the advantages of cross-validation over simple train-test splits, including more reliable performance estimates, better use of available data, and reduced variance in performance estimates. Finally, they should apply cross-validation to estimate model performance more reliably, understanding that the average performance across all folds provides a more robust estimate of how the model will perform on new data.

**Guidance:** Students should understand model training as the core process in machine learning where an algorithm learns patterns from data to make predictions or decisions. They should explain that model parameters are the internal variables that the algorithm adjusts during training (e.g., weights in a neural network, coefficients in linear regression). Students should describe how training data provides the examples from which the model learns, with each example typically consisting of input features and corresponding outputs. They should understand a loss function as a mathematical function that measures how well the model's predictions match the actual values, with the goal of training being to minimize this loss.

- Explain the concept of convergence in model training

**Guidance:** Students should describe model training as an iterative process where the algorithm repeatedly makes predictions, calculates errors, and adjusts parameters to improve performance. They should explain that an epoch represents one complete pass through the entire training dataset, while an iteration represents one update of the model parameters (which may involve processing a batch of data). Students should understand that models typically improve progressively with each iteration as they learn more patterns from the data, though improvement may slow down over time. They should identify factors that determine when to stop training, such as when the model performance stops improving, when a maximum number of epochs is reached, or when the model starts to overfit. Students should explain convergence as the state where further training iterations result in minimal improvement in the model's performance, indicating that the model has learned as much as it can from the training data.

**Guidance:** Students should explain that supervised learning models learn by finding patterns that map input features to known output labels, adjusting parameters to minimize prediction errors. They should describe how unsupervised learning models learn by discovering inherent structures or patterns in unlabeled data, such as grouping similar data points or reducing dimensionality. Students should explain that reinforcement learning models learn through trial and error by taking actions in an environment and receiving rewards or penalties, adjusting their behavior to maximize cumulative rewards. They should compare the learning processes of different algorithm types, such as neural networks (which learn through backpropagation and gradient descent) versus decision trees (which learn by recursively splitting data based on feature values).

For decision trees, they should apply the process of recursively splitting data based on features that maximize information gain or minimize impurity. Students should understand how k-means clustering is trained by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster centroid and updating centroids based on the assigned points. For a simple neural network, they should implement the training process including forward propagation, loss calculation, backpropagation, and parameter updates. Students should evaluate the training progress of different algorithms by monitoring metrics like loss or accuracy over epochs, and visualize this progress to understand how different algorithms learn at different rates.

- Recognize the consequences of inadequate model evaluation

**Guidance:** Students should understand model evaluation as the systematic process of assessing a trained model's performance, typically using metrics that quantify how well the model's predictions match actual values. They should explain that evaluation is essential because it provides objective measures of model quality, helps identify strengths and weaknesses, and informs decisions about model deployment or improvement. Students should identify the key goals of evaluation: measuring performance (quantifying how well the model works), comparing models (determining which model performs better), and ensuring generalization (verifying that the model works well on new, unseen data). They should understand the relationship between evaluation and deployment, recognizing that thorough evaluation is necessary before deploying models in real-world applications where errors can have significant consequences. Students should recognize the consequences of inadequate evaluation, such as deploying models that perform poorly in practice, making incorrect decisions based on flawed models, or missing opportunities to improve model performance.

- Create and interpret confusion matrices for classification results
- Understand the trade-offs between different classification metrics
- Apply appropriate metrics for imbalanced classification problems

**Guidance:** Students should learn to calculate accuracy as the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions, and interpret its value (e.g., an accuracy of 0.85 means 85% of predictions were correct). They should compute precision (true positives / (true positives + false positives)) as a measure of exactness, and recall (true positives / (true positives + false negatives)) as a measure of completeness, explaining what each metric reveals about model performance. Students should calculate the F1-score (2 × (precision × recall) / (precision + recall)) as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, understanding that it provides a balanced measure that considers both metrics. They should create confusion matrices, which show the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, and interpret them to understand where the model is making errors. Students should understand the trade-offs between metrics, such as how improving precision often reduces recall, and vice versa. Finally, they should apply appropriate metrics for imbalanced classification problems, recognizing that accuracy can be misleading when classes are imbalanced, and metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the ROC curve may be more informative.

**Guidance:** Students should learn to calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values, and interpret it as the average magnitude of errors in the predictions (e.g., an MAE of 5 means predictions are, on average, 5 units away from actual values). They should compute Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the average of squared differences between predicted and actual values, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the square root of MSE, explaining that MSE gives more weight to larger errors due to squaring, while RMSE is in the same units as the target variable. Students should calculate R-squared as the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model, interpreting values between 0 and 1 (e.g., an R-squared of 0.75 means the model explains 75% of the variance in the target variable). They should understand the advantages and limitations of different metrics, such as MAE being more robust to outliers but less sensitive to large errors, or MSE being more sensitive to outliers but potentially harder to interpret. Students should apply appropriate metrics based on the specific problem, considering factors like the presence of outliers, the importance of large errors, and the need for interpretability. Finally, they should compare model performance using multiple metrics to get a comprehensive view of model quality.

They should explain that the purpose of validation includes estimating model performance on new data, selecting the best model from multiple candidates, tuning hyperparameters, and detecting overfitting. Students should distinguish between training error (error on the data used to train the model), validation error (error on data used to tune the model), and test error (error on data held out until the final evaluation), understanding that training error typically underestimates the true error rate, while validation and test error provide more realistic estimates. They should understand how validation helps detect overfitting (when validation error is much higher than training error) and underfitting (when both training and validation error are high). Students should recognize validation as a critical step in model development and selection, emphasizing that models that perform well on training data but poorly on validation data are unlikely to generalize well to new data.

**Guidance:** Students should implement random train-test split, which randomly divides the dataset into training and testing sets according to a specified ratio (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing). They should apply stratified train-test split for classification problems, which ensures that the class distribution is preserved in both training and testing sets, particularly important for imbalanced datasets. Students should determine appropriate ratios for splitting data, considering factors like dataset size (smaller datasets may require larger training sets) and the need for reliable performance estimates (larger test sets provide more reliable estimates but less data for training). They should understand the importance of setting a random state parameter to ensure reproducible splits, allowing consistent results across multiple runs. Students should evaluate model performance by training on the training set and testing on the test set, calculating appropriate metrics based on the problem type.

They should apply stratified k-fold cross-validation for classification problems, which maintains the class distribution in each fold, particularly important for imbalanced datasets. Students should understand leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), where k equals the number of instances in the dataset, meaning each instance is used as the test set once, and recognize its computational implications (training a model n times for n instances, which can be prohibitively expensive for large datasets). They should compare the results of different cross-validation techniques, observing how they provide different estimates of model performance and variance. Students should interpret cross-validation results by calculating the mean and standard deviation of performance metrics across folds, understanding that the mean provides an estimate of model performance while the standard deviation indicates the variability of this estimate.

They should implement grid search, which exhaustively tries all possible combinations of hyperparameters from a predefined set, evaluating each combination using cross-validation. Students should apply random search, which samples random combinations of hyperparameters from specified distributions, often finding good solutions more efficiently than grid search. They should understand cross-validated hyperparameter tuning, where each hyperparameter combination is evaluated using cross-validation to provide a more robust estimate of performance. Students should evaluate the impact of hyperparameter tuning by comparing model performance before and after tuning, recognizing that appropriate hyperparameters can significantly improve model performance.

**Guidance:** Students should define ensemble methods as techniques that combine multiple base models to produce a single improved model, often resulting in better performance than any individual model. They should implement simple ensemble techniques, such as voting (combining predictions from multiple models through majority voting for classification or averaging for regression) and averaging (calculating the mean of predictions from multiple models). Students should apply bagging methods like Random Forest, which builds multiple decision trees on different subsets of the training data and combines their predictions, reducing variance and overfitting. They should apply boosting methods like AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting, which build models sequentially, with each new model focusing on correcting the errors of the previous ones, often resulting in improved accuracy.

Students should recognize that machine learning projects are iterative, with insights from later stages often requiring revisiting earlier stages (e.g., poor evaluation might lead to revisiting data preparation or model selection). They should understand how different stages inform each other, such as how data exploration informs feature engineering, or how evaluation results guide model improvement.
