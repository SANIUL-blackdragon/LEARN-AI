3. Text Input Block and 6. Prompt Input Block is the same thing, dude. We can use "8. Conversation Flow Block" as the starter and ender of workflows we want for a conversation flow going and ending. 9. Model Selection Block is a waste. 18. Loop Block works like we can have a block called "if-else block" which will have 2 output points 1 for if and 1 for else and in else or if we can attach the loop block and we can conncet the output point to the block from which the loop should happen. By the way there will be multiple points for 1 block for most blocks and we can drag between 1 another and wire like things connect similar to how we can do it in Unreal Engine connecting blocks like that but some blocks like 14. File Storage Block is not needing an output point because after input it just saves. 19. Parallel Execution Block is a waste because the parallel sessions to run the extension with different co figurations selected in multiple tabs counts as seperate identities so they have no corelation to each other if in different tabs to not mess up one another somehow. We do not need Configuration Block because when we working with blocks it counts as co figuration. Dude use proper logic as to how blocks should work. It is like using unreal engine visual programming where you can connect stuff without a need to code with things thats been given to you. Similarly is how our system configuration will work and similarly there can be multiple input and output points and in some cases no output points because notifier will take inputs and just notify, no output for workflow and same goes for some other blocks. I am not happy with how you designed the blocks. Be more logical
