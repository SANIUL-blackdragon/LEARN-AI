**Guidance:** Students should understand reinforcement learning as a cycle where an agent observes the environment, takes actions, and receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. They should be able to diagram the interaction loop showing how the agent selects actions, the environment transitions to new states, and the agent receives new observations and rewards. Simple examples like a game character navigating a maze or a thermostat controlling room temperature should be used to illustrate this concept. The connection to how humans learn from trial and error should be emphasized.

**9.1.2 Understand states, observations, actions, and rewards**

**Guidance:** Students should understand that a state is a complete description of the environment, while an observation is partial information that the agent receives. They should distinguish between discrete actions (like choosing left, right, up, down in a game) and continuous actions (like setting a thermostat to any temperature within a range). They should understand rewards as numerical feedback signals that indicate how good an action was. Examples should include simple games where states are board positions, observations are what the player can see, actions are moves, and rewards are points scored or lost.

**Guidance:** Students should understand a policy as a mapping from states (or observations) to actions. They should recognize that deterministic policies always select the same action in a given state, while stochastic policies select actions with certain probabilities. Examples should include simple rules like "always turn left at a T-junction" (deterministic) versus "turn left 70% of the time and right 30% of the time" (stochastic). The connection to personal decision-making strategies should be emphasized, such as following a strict study schedule versus sometimes varying study methods.

They should understand return as the sum of future rewards, possibly with discounting. Simple examples should include calculating the return for short sequences of actions in a game, such as collecting points over several moves. The concept of "delayed gratification" should be used to illustrate why agents need to consider long-term rewards rather than just immediate ones.

They should identify the key components: a set of states, a set of actions, a transition function that defines the probability of moving from one state to another given an action, and a reward function that specifies the immediate reward for each action in each state. They should understand the Markov property as the "memoryless" property that the future depends only on the current state and action, not on the history of previous states and actions. Simple examples like a grid world or a simple game should be used to illustrate these concepts.

Similarly, they should understand that discrete action spaces have a finite number of actions (like moves in a board game), while continuous action spaces have an infinite range of possible actions (like setting a thermostat to any temperature). Examples should include board games (discrete states and actions), robot control (continuous states and actions), and hybrid scenarios.

They should understand continuing tasks as those that continue indefinitely without a natural endpoint, such as a thermostat controlling room temperature or a factory robot that operates continuously. Examples should include games (episodic) versus ongoing control systems (continuing). The connection to how return is calculated should be emphasized, with episodic tasks having finite returns and continuing tasks typically using discounted returns to ensure the sum remains finite.

The challenge of reward design should be emphasized, including the risk of "reward hacking" where agents find unexpected ways to maximize the reward without achieving the intended goal. Real-world examples should include the challenge of specifying goals for autonomous systems.

Examples should include navigation problems (states are locations, actions are movements, transitions are the results of movements, rewards are for reaching destinations), resource management problems (states are resource levels, actions are resource allocations, transitions are changes in resource levels, rewards are for achieving objectives), and simple games. The simplifications made when formulating problems as MDPs should be discussed, such as assuming the Markov property or discretizing continuous states and actions. The limitations of the MDP framework for complex problems should be acknowledged, such as partial observability or extremely large state spaces.

**Guidance:** Students should understand policy improvement as the process of making a policy better based on its value function. They should learn the policy improvement theorem, which states that changing the policy to select actions that maximize the expected value (according to the current value function) will yield a policy that is at least as good as the original policy. Simple examples should include improving a policy in a grid world by choosing actions that lead to higher-value states. The connection to improving real-world decisions should be emphasized, such as choosing a better route to work based on traffic information.

**Guidance:** Students should understand value iteration as an algorithm that directly computes the optimal value function by repeatedly applying the Bellman optimality equation. They should learn that, unlike policy iteration, value iteration doesn't wait for value estimates to converge before improving the policy. Instead, it implicitly improves the policy with each update. Simple examples should include applying value iteration to small grid worlds to find optimal paths.

They should learn that this process continues until the policy no longer changes. Simple examples should include applying policy iteration to small grid worlds and observing how the policy improves with each iteration. The comparison with value iteration should highlight that policy iteration typically requires fewer iterations but each iteration is more computationally expensive.

**Guidance:** Students should understand that dynamic programming methods require knowledge of the complete MDP model (transition probabilities and reward function) and can be computationally expensive for large state spaces. They should learn that the computational complexity is typically polynomial in the number of states, which makes these methods impractical for problems with very large or continuous state spaces. Approaches to address these challenges should include function approximation, state abstraction, and sampling methods. The trade-offs between different methods should be discussed, such as the faster convergence of policy iteration versus the simpler implementation of value iteration. Real-world examples should include why these methods work well for board games but struggle with complex robotics problems.

**Guidance:** Students should understand Monte Carlo methods as approaches that learn directly from experience by sampling returns rather than using the complete model of the environment. They should learn that Monte Carlo prediction estimates value functions by averaging the returns observed after visiting each state. The difference between first-visit methods (which average returns following only the first visit to a state in an episode) and every-visit methods (which average returns following every visit to a state) should be clearly explained. Simple examples should include estimating the value of states in a basic game by playing multiple episodes and averaging the results. The connection to learning from experience in real life should be emphasized, such as estimating the value of different study strategies based on test results.

Simple examples should include applying Monte Carlo control with exploring starts to simple grid world problems. The challenges of maintaining exploration should be discussed, particularly that exploring starts may not be feasible in many real-world problems. The connection to trying different strategies in real life should be emphasized, such as exploring different career paths to find the most rewarding one.

**9.4.3 Differentiate between on-policy and off-policy learning**

They should learn that off-policy learning is important because it allows agents to learn about optimal policies while following a more exploratory behavior policy. Examples should include Monte Carlo control with exploring starts as an on-policy method and Q-learning as an off-policy method. The connection to real-world learning should be emphasized, such as learning from observing others' experiences (off-policy) versus learning only from one's own experiences (on-policy).

They should learn that importance sampling weights the returns by the ratio of the probability of the trajectory under the target policy to the probability under the behavior policy. The difference between ordinary importance sampling (which uses a simple average of weighted returns) and weighted importance sampling (which uses a weighted average) should be explained. Simple examples should include estimating the value of a conservative policy using data generated by a more exploratory policy. The connection to learning from others' experiences in real life should be emphasized, such as adjusting advice based on differences between one's own behavior and the advisor's behavior.

**9.4.5 Differentiate between first-visit and every-visit methods**

- Define every-visit methods as those that consider every visit to a state in an episode
- Compare the properties of first-visit and every-visit methods
- Apply both methods to simple problems and compare the results

**Guidance:** Students should understand that first-visit Monte Carlo methods average the returns following only the first occurrence of a state in an episode, while every-visit methods average the returns following all occurrences of a state. They should learn that first-visit methods are theoretically simpler to analyze, while every-visit methods may have advantages in certain situations, particularly when the state is revisited within the same episode. Simple examples should include applying both methods to estimate the value of states in a simple grid world and comparing the results. The connection to real-world learning should be emphasized, such as learning from the first attempt at a task versus learning from all attempts.

**Guidance:** Students should understand that Monte Carlo methods typically require less memory than dynamic programming methods but may require many episodes to converge to accurate estimates. They should learn that the variance of Monte Carlo estimates can be high, leading to slow convergence, particularly for rare events. The importance of balancing exploration and exploitation should be emphasized, as Monte Carlo methods require sufficient exploration of all state-action pairs to work well. Situations where Monte Carlo methods are most appropriate should include problems with episodic tasks, unknown environment dynamics, and when complete episodes can be generated relatively quickly. Real-world examples should include game playing, where complete episodes are naturally defined, versus continuous control tasks, which may be better suited to other methods.

They should learn that TD methods can learn online after each step, without waiting for the end of an episode. The TD(0) algorithm should be explained as updating the value of a state based on the immediate reward plus the estimated value of the next state. Simple examples should include estimating the value of states in a small grid world by updating values after each move. The connection to real-time learning should be emphasized, such as updating one's opinion about a restaurant after each course rather than waiting until the end of the meal.

**Guidance:** Students should understand SARSA as an on-policy TD control method that estimates action-value functions rather than state-value functions. They should learn that SARSA updates action-value estimates based on the tuple (s, a, r, s', a'), where the agent takes action a in state s, receives reward r, transitions to state s', and then takes action a' according to the current policy. Simple examples should include applying SARSA to a basic grid world problem and observing how the action-value estimates change over time. The connection to learning from one's own experiences should be emphasized, such as learning to play a game by trying moves and seeing the results.

**Guidance:** Students should understand Q-Learning as an off-policy TD control method that directly learns the optimal action-value function, regardless of the policy being followed. They should learn that Q-Learning updates action-value estimates using the maximum value of the next state, rather than the value of the action actually taken. Simple examples should include applying Q-Learning to a basic grid world problem and comparing its performance with SARSA. The comparison should highlight that Q-Learning learns the optimal policy even while following an exploratory policy, while SARSA learns the value of the policy it's actually following. The connection to learning from others' experiences should be emphasized, such as learning the best way to do something by observing experts, even while still practicing a different way.

They should learn that Expected SARSA can be viewed as a generalization of both SARSA and Q-Learning, depending on how the action probabilities are set. Simple examples should include applying Expected SARSA to a basic grid world problem and comparing its performance with SARSA and Q-Learning. The comparison should highlight that Expected SARSA can be more stable than SARSA and less optimistic than Q-Learning. The connection to considering all possibilities should be emphasized, such as making decisions based on the average outcome of all possible choices rather than just one.

- Implement Double Q-Learning for simple problems
- Compare the performance of Double Q-Learning with standard Q-Learning

**Guidance:** Students should understand that Q-Learning can suffer from maximization bias, where the maximum action-value estimates are overly optimistic due to the same samples being used both to select the maximum and to estimate its value. They should learn that Double Q-Learning addresses this by maintaining two separate value functions and using one to select the best action and the other to estimate its value. Simple examples should include demonstrating the maximization bias in a simple environment and showing how Double Q-Learning reduces this bias. The connection to avoiding overconfidence should be emphasized, such as getting a second opinion when making important decisions to avoid being overly optimistic.

- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of each approach
- Describe situations where each method is most appropriate
- Understand the concept of TD(λ) as a generalization that combines TD and Monte Carlo

**Guidance:** Students should understand that TD methods update estimates based on other learned estimates (bootstrapping) and can learn online after each step, while Monte Carlo methods wait until the end of an episode to update estimates based on the actual return. They should learn that TD methods typically learn faster but can be more sensitive to the initial estimates, while Monte Carlo methods are more stable but require complete episodes. The concept of TD(λ) should be introduced as a method that combines the advantages of both approaches by using a parameter λ to balance between TD and Monte Carlo updates. Examples should include comparing the performance of TD and Monte Carlo methods on simple problems. The connection to different learning styles should be emphasized, such as learning incrementally after each experience versus waiting to see the final outcome.

They should learn that experience replay helps break correlations in sequential data and improves data efficiency. Target networks should be explained as a copy of the Q-network that is updated more slowly and used to generate targets for learning, which helps stabilize training. Simple examples should include implementing experience replay and target networks in a basic Q-learning algorithm.

**Guidance:** Students should understand the main challenges of value function approximation, including the risk of divergence (where the estimates grow without bound), instability due to non-stationary targets, and the difficulty of representing complex value functions. They should learn that off-policy learning with function approximation is particularly prone to divergence, as the distribution of states and actions experienced can differ significantly from the target policy. Methods to address these challenges should include target networks, gradient clipping, and careful feature engineering. The trade-offs between different approximation methods should be discussed, such as the balance between representational power and stability. The connection to managing complexity in real-world problems should be emphasized, such as how simplifying assumptions and careful design can help manage complex systems.

Simple examples should include illustrating how adjusting policy parameters can improve performance in a basic grid world. The connection to direct learning should be emphasized, such as learning a skill by directly adjusting one's approach rather than first learning to evaluate different approaches.

They should learn that Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) uses this advantage function instead of the raw value function, which reduces variance and improves learning. The difference between A2C and A3C should be explained: A2C uses multiple parallel environments, while A3C uses asynchronous parallel agents. Simple examples should include implementing a basic A2C algorithm for a simple problem.

Simple examples should include implementing a basic count-based exploration strategy in a grid world environment. The comparison with other strategies should highlight that count-based methods directly encourage visiting novel states rather than just trying different actions. The connection to curiosity should be emphasized, such as being naturally drawn to new experiences rather than familiar ones.

The challenges of multi-agent learning should include non-stationarity (the environment changes as other agents learn), credit assignment (determining which agents are responsible for outcomes), and coordination. Examples should include team games, autonomous vehicle coordination, and trading systems. The connection to social interactions should be emphasized, such as how people learn and adapt their behavior based on others' actions.

**Guidance:** Students should understand partial observability as situations where the agent cannot directly observe the complete state of the environment. They should learn that POMDPs extend MDPs by explicitly modeling the agent's observations, which are partial or noisy signals about the underlying state. The challenges of learning in POMDPs should include the need to maintain a belief state (a probability distribution over possible states) and the increased complexity of planning and learning. Examples should include robotics with limited sensors, card games where some information is hidden, and dialogue systems where the user's intent is not directly observable. The connection to real-world decision making should be emphasized, such as making decisions based on incomplete information.
