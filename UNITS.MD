Continual learning should enable edge devices to learn new tasks without forgetting previous ones. Privacy-preserving techniques should ensure that on-device learning doesn't compromise user privacy.

**7.42.4 Implement energy-constrained ML optimization**
- Apply energy-aware model design
- Implement dynamic voltage and frequency scaling for ML
- Use approximate computing for energy efficiency
- Apply energy harvesting-aware ML systems

**Guidance:** Students should implement model design techniques that optimize for energy efficiency rather than just accuracy.

Energy harvesting-aware systems should adapt their behavior based on available energy from sources like solar, kinetic, or thermal energy harvesting.

###### Topic 43: Advanced ML for Extreme Data Scarcity

Students will be assessed on their ability to:

**7.43.1 Understand few-shot and zero-shot learning challenges**
- Explain the fundamental challenges of learning with limited data
- Understand different types of data scarcity scenarios
- Apply evaluation metrics for few-shot learning
- Analyze the role of prior knowledge in data-scarce learning

**Guidance:** Students should understand that learning with very few examples per class requires fundamentally different approaches than traditional supervised learning. They should explore scenarios including few-shot learning (small number of examples per class), one-shot learning (single example per class), and zero-shot learning (no examples for some classes). Evaluation metrics should measure performance on novel classes with limited training data. Students should analyze how prior knowledge, transfer learning, and inductive biases enable learning from scarce data.

**7.43.2 Implement advanced few-shot learning methods**
- Apply metric learning approaches for few-shot learning
- Implement optimization-based few-shot learning (MAML)
- Use memory-augmented networks for few-shot learning
- Apply meta-learning for rapid adaptation

**Guidance:** Students should implement metric learning methods that learn embeddings where similar classes are close in the embedding space. Optimization-based approaches like MAML should learn model parameters that can quickly adapt to new tasks with few gradient updates. Memory-augmented networks should use external memory to store and retrieve information from few examples. Meta-learning should enable systems to learn how to learn efficiently from limited data.

**7.43.3 Apply zero-shot learning with semantic knowledge**
- Implement attribute-based zero-shot learning
- Apply text-based zero-shot learning
- Use knowledge graphs for zero-shot learning

Knowledge graphs should provide structured semantic information for zero-shot prediction. Applications should include both visual domains (recognizing unseen object categories) and textual domains (classifying unseen topics or sentiments).

**7.43.4 Implement self-supervised learning with minimal data**
- Apply contrastive self-supervised learning
- Implement generative self-supervised methods
- Use self-supervised learning for pre-training
- Apply self-supervised learning to domain-specific data scarcity

**Guidance:** Students should implement contrastive self-supervised learning that learns representations by contrasting positive and negative pairs. Generative methods should use autoencoders, GANs, or diffusion models to learn from unlabeled data. Self-supervised pre-training should learn general representations from unlabeled data before fine-tuning on limited labeled data. Domain-specific applications should address data scarcity in fields like medical imaging, scientific research, or specialized industrial applications.

**Guidance:** Students should understand that not all data naturally fits into Euclidean spaces with flat geometry. They should explore different non-Euclidean spaces including hyperbolic spaces (constant negative curvature), spherical spaces (constant positive curvature), and more general Riemannian manifolds. Manifold learning should reveal the underlying geometric structure of data. Students should analyze scenarios where non-Euclidean representations are beneficial, including hierarchical data, periodic data, and data with complex relational structures.

**7.44.2 Implement hyperbolic neural networks**
- Apply hyperbolic geometry for hierarchical data
- Implement hyperbolic embeddings and operations

**Guidance:** Students should implement spherical neural networks that operate on the surface of spheres, suitable for periodic data like angles, directions, or cyclic phenomena. Projective geometry should be applied to computer vision tasks involving perspective and camera transformations. Spherical embeddings should represent directional data including 3D orientations, wind directions, or magnetic fields. Geometric deep learning should generalize neural network operations to arbitrary non-Euclidean spaces.

**7.44.4 Implement manifold learning and geometric deep learning**
- Apply manifold regularization in neural networks
- Implement geometric deep learning on manifolds
- Use manifold-valued outputs for regression tasks
- Apply non-Euclidean ML to real-world applications

**Guidance:** Students should implement manifold regularization that incorporates geometric constraints into neural network training. Geometric deep learning should generalize convolutional and other operations to manifold-structured data. Manifold-valued regression should predict outputs that lie on specific manifolds rather than in Euclidean space. Real-world applications should include computer vision, robotics, physics simulation, and other domains where data naturally has non-Euclidean structure.

**Guidance:** Students should understand that causal inference in time series data presents unique challenges including temporal dependencies, feedback loops, and the need to respect temporal ordering. They should explore methods for discovering causal relationships from time series data including constraint-based approaches and score-based methods. Granger causality should be implemented and its limitations analyzed, including its inability to distinguish between direct and indirect causal effects. Students should analyze how temporal ordering provides additional constraints for causal inference compared to cross-sectional data.

**7.45.2 Implement counterfactual reasoning in time series**
- Apply counterfactual prediction for temporal data
- Implement temporal intervention analysis
- Use counterfactual explanations for time series models
- Apply counterfactual reasoning to policy evaluation

**Guidance:** Students should implement methods to predict what would have happened in time series under different interventions or conditions. Temporal intervention analysis should estimate the effects of interventions that occur at specific time points. Counterfactual explanations should show how past conditions would need to change to achieve different future outcomes. Policy evaluation should use counterfactual reasoning to assess the impact of policies implemented at specific times.

**7.45.3 Apply causal discovery from temporal data**
- Implement constraint-based causal discovery for time series
- Apply score-based methods for temporal causal discovery
- Use functional causal models for time series
- Apply causal discovery to real-world temporal datasets

**Guidance:** Students should implement constraint-based methods like PC or FCI algorithms adapted for time series data that respect temporal ordering constraints. Score-based methods should search for causal structures that optimize scoring criteria while respecting temporal constraints. Functional causal models should represent causal relationships as functions with noise terms. Real-world applications should include economics, neuroscience, climate science, and other fields with rich temporal data.

**7.45.4 Implement causal reinforcement learning**
- Apply causal models to improve RL sample efficiency
- Implement causal world models for RL
- Use causal RL for robust policy learning
- Apply causal RL to intervention planning

**Guidance:** Students should implement RL systems that incorporate causal models to improve sample efficiency by leveraging causal structure. Causal world models should learn causal relationships that enable better planning and generalization. Causal RL should learn policies that are robust to changes in the environment by understanding the underlying causal structure. Intervention planning should use causal reasoning to plan sequences of actions that achieve desired outcomes.
